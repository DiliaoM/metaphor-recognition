# Metaphor-Recognition
This is a program that used for making metaphor recognition in several Chinese sentences. This could help grading the article in a way. 

We first crawled the composition corpus from the Internet and split it into individual sentences. After doing the text preprocessing, we constructed word vectors and sentence vectors, and then used support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithm training data to obtain recognition and evaluation results.

There are mainly two process, one is to decide if the sentence includes metaphor or note, the other is to give the grade to these sentences if it is a metaphorical sentence.
